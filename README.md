# jw.odot
A repo of odot/Max abstractions/bpatchers for signal processing.

Begun in the Fall of 2024, this repo contains a number of useful abstractions that leverage Odot to solve common problems in Max. There are even a few truly novel things here. As this is largely a sandbox space for working out ideas, many of the patches in this repo may be less than fully documented and fully functional. If this is your first time here, I suggest having a look at those abstractions for which a .maxhelp file exists.

Have fun.
